# Ultrawide Wallpaper Resizer

This project aims to adjust wallpapers from [DMB](https://www.dualmonitorbackgrounds.com/) website to fit on my screens width.

## The problem

I have a ultra widescreen (2560x1080) connected to a UHD laptop (1920x1080), and i want to use wallpapers that fits all my visual screen width (4480x1080).

## The solution

The [DMB](https://www.dualmonitorbackgrounds.com/) website has a bunch of wallpapers ready to use on dual screen. But the total width of this wallpapers not match with my total screen width. Well, lets develop a solution! This node.js app ajust the width / height to my correct resolutions.
